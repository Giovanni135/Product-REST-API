REST API Project

This is the first of a few projects that I will be working on in order to become better versed with REST API's as well as increasing familiarity with databases. 
This first project presently contains two objects that I have created using Atom, mongojs, inside of the mongo shell using json.


Self notes: Run mongo to run mongo in the background
            Run mongod
            Run npm start
