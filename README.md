REST API Project

This is the first of a few projects that I will be working on in order to become better versed with REST API's. 
This first project presently contains two objects that I have created using Atom, mongojs, inside of the mongo shell using json.
Self notes: Run mongod to run mongo in the background, then on separate shell run nodemon to start up the server.
